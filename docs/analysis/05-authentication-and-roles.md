# Authentication and Authorization Requirements for Todo List Application

## Authentication Requirements

### Core Authentication Functions (All requirements in EARS format)
- WHEN a user registers, THE system SHALL require a unique email address and password for account creation.
- WHEN a user attempts to register with an email already associated with an existing account, THE system SHALL block the registration and provide a clear error message.
- WHEN a user logs in, THE system SHALL validate credentials and SHALL provide secure, temporary access via an authentication token if credentials are correct.
- IF login credentials are invalid, THEN THE system SHALL prevent account access and relay an explicit authentication error.
- WHEN a user requests to reset their password, THE system SHALL require a valid email address and SHALL initiate a password reset flow, sending a time-limited reset link to the associated email.
- IF an invalid or expired password reset token is used, THEN THE system SHALL deny password change and provide a clear error message.
- WHEN a user is authenticated, THE system SHALL allow the user to change their password, edit their own registered email, and log out from all devices.
- THE system SHALL permit only registered, authenticated users to access private todo features.

### Email Verification (Optional Minimal Requirement)
- WHERE email verification is enabled, THE system SHALL send a unique verification link after registration and SHALL permit user login only after successful email confirmation.

## Role Structure and Hierarchy

### User Role (Minimal Model)
- THE system SHALL support a single role: user.
- EACH user SHALL own, create, view, update, and delete only their own todo items.
- THE system SHALL prevent all users from viewing, modifying, or deleting todos owned by other users.
- THE system SHALL allow users to manage personal settings (change password/email, update profile if supported, delete account).

### Role Definition Table

| Role | Description                                                        |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| user | A registered, authenticated user; can CRUD their own todos; cannot access others; can manage own settings |

## Permission Matrix

| System Action                                   | user |
|-------------------------------------------------|------|
| Register new account                            | ✅   |
| Login / Logout                                  | ✅   |
| Password reset                                  | ✅   |
| View own todo list                              | ✅   |
| Create todo                                     | ✅   |
| Update own todo                                 | ✅   |
| Delete own todo                                 | ✅   |
| View, update, or delete another user's todo     | ❌   |
| Change own email or password                    | ✅   |
| Delete own account                              | ✅   |
| Access system without authentication            | ❌   |

- WHEN any user attempts to perform an unauthorized action per this matrix, THE system SHALL reject the request and provide a clear, actionable error message.

## Token Management

- THE system SHALL use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and maintaining user state.
- WHEN a user logs in, THE system SHALL generate a short-lived access token (recommended 15–30 minutes) and a long-lived refresh token (recommended 7–30 days).
- THE JWT payload SHALL contain user id, role, and permissions array for access control decision-making.
- WHERE logout is invoked, THE system SHALL revoke/blacklist active tokens to immediately terminate access.
- IF a refresh token is expired, invalid, or revoked, THEN THE system SHALL prevent token refresh and require re-authentication via user credentials.
- THE system SHALL allow users to trigger global logout, revoking tokens on all devices.

## Session Handling and Security

- THE system SHALL only permit authenticated users (with valid tokens) to perform any todo-related CRUD actions.
- WHERE JWT token is expired or tampered, THE system SHALL deny access and mandate re-authentication.
- WHERE password is changed, THE system SHALL revoke all previously issued tokens.
- IF suspicious login activity is detected (e.g., access from multiple locations/devices), THEN THE system SHALL notify the user and may, per business rule, request additional verification or enforce logout.
- THE system SHALL limit failed login attempts per account and/or IP within a short window to mitigate brute-force attacks (e.g., 5 attempts per 10 minutes).
- THE system SHALL protect user session tokens from CSRF/XSS by strongly recommending secure token storage and transmission mechanisms.
- THE system SHALL log all authentication and authorization failures for monitoring and abuse detection, without exposing sensitive reason codes to end users.

## Business Rules and Constraints

- THE system SHALL NOT expose any user-identifiable information to unauthenticated users or other users.
- IF a user is deleted, THEN THE system SHALL permanently remove that user's todos and data after required retention periods.
- THE system SHALL enforce unique, case-insensitive emails for account registration.
- THE system SHALL enforce strong password rules (minimum length, no trivial passwords, etc.), with specifics per business policy.

## Error Handling (Reference)
- WHEN permission or authentication errors occur, THE system SHALL provide user-friendly, actionable error messages without revealing internal state or sensitive cause codes. See [Error Handling Requirements](./07-error-handling.md) for scenario-specific guidance.

## Developer Autonomy
This document specifies WHAT business requirements and processes must be implemented for authentication and role-based access control in the Todo List application. Technical solutions (database, API, cryptographic methods, token storage, etc.) are entirely at the discretion of the development team. All implementation decisions for session management, storage, and security are left to developer expertise by business requirement.
