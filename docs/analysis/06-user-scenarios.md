# User Scenarios for Minimal Todo List Application

## Introduction
This document presents comprehensive user scenarios for the minimal Todo list application, focusing exclusively on essential interactions and flows as defined by the minimal business requirements. Its purpose is to equip product and backend teams with life-like scenarios, ensuring clarity around expected user behavior, core journeys, and major edge cases for both standard users and administrators.

## Primary User Journeys

### 1. Registering and Logging In
**Scenario 1:** New User Registration and Login
- A visitor accesses the Todo service landing page.
- They choose to register an account, providing a valid email address and password.
- Upon successful registration, the user is prompted to log in.
- The user enters credentials and is signed in, establishing a secure session.

**EARS:**
- WHEN a non-registered visitor submits the registration form with a unique, valid email and password, THE system SHALL create a new user account.
- IF the email is already used, THEN THE system SHALL reject the registration and display an error message.
- WHEN a user submits correct login credentials, THE system SHALL grant access to their account.
- IF login credentials are invalid, THEN THE system SHALL deny access and present an error notification.

### 2. Creating a Todo Task
**Scenario 2:** User Adds a Task
- The logged-in user views their empty task list.
- They add a new task by entering a short description (e.g., "Buy groceries").
- The new task appears immediately in their list.

**EARS:**
- WHEN a user submits a new todo description, THE system SHALL add the task to the user’s list and show immediate confirmation.
- IF the task description is missing or exceeds character limits, THEN THE system SHALL reject the creation attempt and present a validation error.

### 3. Viewing the Todo List
**Scenario 3:** User Reviews Todo List and Status
- Upon logging in, the user sees their current list of todos.
- Tasks are clearly displayed, indicating whether each is complete or incomplete.
- The user checks remaining tasks and completed work.

**EARS:**
- WHEN a user views their dashboard, THE system SHALL display all existing tasks, sorted by creation date.
- IF the user has no tasks, THEN THE system SHALL present a friendly message and a call to create their first task.

### 4. Editing a Todo Task
**Scenario 4:** User Updates Task Description
- The user decides to update an existing task’s description (typo correction, clarification).
- After editing and saving, the updated text appears in the list.

**EARS:**
- WHEN a user requests to edit a task, THE system SHALL allow description updates, enforcing the same validation rules as for creation.
- IF the user tries to edit a task not owned by them, THEN THE system SHALL deny access.

### 5. Marking Tasks as Complete or Incomplete
**Scenario 5:** Task Status Change
- The user marks a task as complete (e.g., "Finish reading book").
- The completed task is visually distinguished in the list.
- The user can revert the status to incomplete as needed.

**EARS:**
- WHEN a user updates a task’s status, THE system SHALL toggle it between complete and incomplete.
- IF the user attempts to modify another user’s task, THEN THE system SHALL deny the action.

### 6. Deleting Tasks
**Scenario 6:** User Removes a Task
- The user finishes all work and wants to clean up their list.
- They delete a completed or unwanted task; it is removed instantly.

**EARS:**
- WHEN a user requests deletion of a task, THE system SHALL permanently remove it from their list.
- IF the user attempts to delete a nonexistent or unauthorized task, THEN THE system SHALL show an error.

### 7. Logging Out
**Scenario 7:** Ending the Session
- The user chooses to log out using a visible option.
- The system terminates the session and returns to the login screen.
- Any subsequent attempt to access personal data redirects to login.

**EARS:**
- WHEN a user logs out, THE system SHALL terminate the current session immediately.
- IF a user tries to access restricted functions while logged out, THEN THE system SHALL require re-authentication.

### 8. Admin User: Managing All Todos and Users
**Scenario 8:** Admin Oversight
- An admin logs in through the same interface as users.
- They can view all users and todos in the system.
- The admin may delete, view, or update any user’s task as needed for maintenance or emergency recovery.
- Admin can perform user account and data cleanup actions (e.g., in case of system abuse or account compromise).

**EARS:**
- WHERE the user is an admin, THE system SHALL permit management of all user accounts and todos.
- IF an admin deletes a user, THEN THE system SHALL permanently remove all associated data.

## Typical Success Paths

### Registration & Login
1. Visitor registers with valid credentials → receives confirmation → logs in → sees empty todo list.

### Task Creation
1. User adds new task → sees it instantly in list.
2. User creates several tasks → tasks are individually listed and sorted by time.

### Task Management
1. User edits existing task → update reflects immediately.
2. User marks task as complete → status change is shown in UI visibly.
3. User deletes task → task disappears from the list without error.

### Admin Flow
1. Admin logs in → views all users/tasks → removes offensive content → affected data purged immediately.

## Edge Cases & Alternatives

### Invalid or Missing Input Data
- User attempts to register with an email already in use: Registration refused, clear feedback provided.
- User tries to add a task with an empty description or one exceeding max allowed length: Validation error shown.
- User tries to update or delete a nonexistent or unauthorized task: Access denied, error message provided.

### Unauthorized Access Scenarios
- Non-authenticated visitor tries to access the todo list: Redirected to login/registration.
- User attempts to manipulate tasks belonging to another user: Blocked, with clear user-facing error.
- Session expires and user tries to submit action: System prompts for re-authentication.

### System Recovery and Error Resilience
- User’s action fails due to temporary backend issue: System displays a generic error, encourages retry.
- Partial data available (e.g., during temporary sync problems): UI explains status, tasks are re-fetched as soon as possible.

## Summary of User Scenario Coverage
This document has illustrated all main user and admin journeys, as well as boundary and adverse cases, for the minimal Todo list application. Every path represents a business requirement that is traceable in the [Functional Requirements Document](./08-functional-requirements.md) and [User Roles & Permissions Reference](./05-user-roles-permissions.md). Edge cases address the most critical input and security failures, defining expected system behavior to ensure a robust, simple, and usable experience for all roles.
