# Non-Functional Requirements Analysis for Todo List Application

## Introduction
This requirements analysis document outlines the complete non-functional expectations for the "todoList" service—a minimal, secure, reliable, and privacy-respecting Todo list application. The focus is on specifying measurable operational standards, security protocols, privacy safeguards, legal compliance principles, and end-user experience benchmarks, all in natural language and in accordance with the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) method where applicable. Developers are free to choose technical methods, frameworks, and platforms—as long as these requirements are fulfilled.

## 1. Performance Requirements
- THE todoList service SHALL allow an authenticated user to add, update, mark as complete/incomplete, and delete their own todo items, with each operation providing a response to the user within 1 second under standard load conditions (up to 100 listed items per user).
- WHEN an authenticated user requests their complete list of todos, THE todoList service SHALL return all items in the list within 1 second for up to 100 items.
- WHERE users have more than 100 todos, THE todoList service SHALL implement paging such that each page (up to 100 items) is delivered within 1 second.
- IF an operation (such as adding, editing, deleting, or querying todos) is expected to require more than 3 seconds under exceptional circumstances, THEN THE todoList service SHALL inform the user of progress until the operation completes.
- THE todoList service SHALL maintain responsive performance for at least 100 simultaneous authenticated users without performance degradation.

## 2. Reliability and Availability
- THE todoList service SHALL maintain 99.5% or greater operational availability over any continuous 30-day period.
- IF maintenance activities are scheduled that may impact availability, THEN THE todoList service SHALL notify all authenticated users at least 24 hours prior to disruption.
- IF an unexpected service outage occurs, THEN THE todoList service SHALL show a generic interruption message to affected users and log the incident for follow-up.
- THE todoList service SHALL persist user sessions for 24 hours minimum, unless explicitly logged out or a session is revoked for security reasons.
- THE todoList service SHALL provide automated data recovery so that no user todo data is lost due to routine process or server failures.

## 3. Security and Data Privacy
- THE todoList service SHALL strictly require user authentication for any access to a user’s own todos or account settings.
- WHEN any unauthenticated access attempt is made to protected resources, THE todoList service SHALL deny access within 1 second and display an appropriate message.
- THE todoList service SHALL ensure that each user can access, modify, or delete only their own todo items—no user can view or edit others’ data under any circumstances.
- THE todoList service SHALL store all user and todo data using strong encryption in transit and at rest, compliant with current best practices.
- WHEN a user initiates a password or email change, THE todoList service SHALL revoke all session tokens and require the user to re-authenticate.
- THE todoList service SHALL permit users to delete their account (and all associated todo data) fully, with processing completed within 72 hours of request.
- WHERE logs are kept for debugging or errors, THE todoList service SHALL ensure no todo content or identifying user information is logged or exposed.
- THE todoList service SHALL permit users to reset passwords using a time-limited email link (valid for no more than 30 minutes post-issue).
- WHEN a single user has 5 failed login attempts within 10 minutes, THE todoList service SHALL lock the account for 15 minutes to help prevent unauthorized access.
- IF any user data breach is detected or even strongly suspected, THEN THE todoList service SHALL notify all affected users within 72 hours.

## 4. Compliance Considerations
- THE todoList service SHALL comply with all relevant privacy and data protection regulations for its operating region, such as GDPR (for EU users), including user rights to access, export, correct, and fully delete personal data.
- THE todoList service SHALL only collect, store, and process the minimum user data needed for the intended function of the service and SHALL never process user data for unrelated purposes unless explicit consent is obtained.
- WHEN collecting or updating personally identifiable information, THE todoList service SHALL display a clear privacy policy and obtain explicit user consent at registration.
- THE todoList service SHALL provide all personal data to users in a common, portable format within 7 days upon request.
- IF the operating jurisdiction is changed or expanded, THEN THE todoList service SHALL review compliance against all newly relevant legal and regulatory requirements.

## Summary
This requirements analysis exclusively describes the business and operational outcomes required of the todoList backend service in terms of performance, reliability, security, privacy, and regulatory compliance. It assigns the "user" as the only interacting entity with data strictly segregated. Technical implementation is fully at the discretion of the development team. All requirements are written to be actionable and testable from a business perspective, enabling prompt, focused backend development.
