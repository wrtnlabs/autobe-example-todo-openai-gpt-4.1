   * Register a new user account in the todo_list_users table (authentication
   * join operation) for registration and onboarding.
   *
   * This endpoint registers a new user in the 'todo_list_users' table, storing
   * email and a securely hashed password. The 'email' field is required, must
   * be unique, and is used for authentication and communication. The
   * 'password_hash' field stores a salted hash of the user's password, never
   * the plain password; validation and hashing are performed prior to
   * persistence, protecting against common security attacks. The
   * 'is_email_verified' flag is initialized to false, requiring users to
   * complete an email verification flow before full access is granted, as
   * referenced by the schema description. Timestamps for account creation and
   * updates ('created_at', 'updated_at') are managed automatically to enable
   * auditing and compliance.
   *
   * This operation requires strict validation to enforce unique emails
   * (case-insensitive) and strong password rules as dictated by business
   * policy. Attempts to register using an existing email return a specific
   * error. Upon successful registration, email verification is initiated, and
   * access tokens are only issued after successful confirmation. Sensitive
   * information, such as 'password_hash' and internal audit fields, are
   * excluded from API responses.
   *
   * Security is paramount; all fields are verified for proper format,
   * uniqueness, and strength prior to account creation. No authentication is
   * required to access this operation, but access is rate-limited to prevent
   * abuse. Directly integrates with login and password reset flows to enable
   * secure credential management for the user role.
   *
   * Deletion of the created account or updates to email/password are handled by
   * separate endpoints. This operation's activity is logged for audit and
   * privacy compliance. All authentication workflows for 'user' originate here,
   * and all user-owned resources in related tables cascade upon full account
   * deletion.

  /**
   * User login/authentication for the todo_list_users table (login to receive
   * JWT access and refresh tokens).
   *
   * This endpoint authenticates a user via credentials (email and password)
   * using 'todo_list_users'. It enforces case-insensitive email lookup,
   * explicit null-check of 'deleted_at' (account must not be soft-deleted), and
   * confirms 'is_email_verified' is true before issuing authentication tokens.
   * Passwords are validated against the 'password_hash' field using a secure,
   * salted comparison that prevents timing attacks or credential leaks. On
   * success, issues JWT tokens and records a session in the
   * 'todo_list_auth_sessions' table for session auditing and active login
   * management.
   *
   * Unsuccessful attempts are handled by business rules: generic error messages
   * are returned (never revealing if email or password was incorrect) and
   * repeated failed attempts are rate-limited to mitigate brute-force attacks.
   * If 'is_email_verified' is false, no login is permitted and a
   * verification-needed message is issued. If 'deleted_at' is not null, login
   * is also prohibited, indicating the account is disabled or deleted.
   *
   * No password hash or credential details are ever exposed to clients, and
   * successful authentications update last-used session information for
   * security monitoring. Password changes and global logout by session are
   * handled via other endpoints using the session and password reset tables
   * described in the schema. Logs authentication attempts for audit purposes
   * and integrates closely with join/registration and password reset
   * operations.
   *
   * Operation requires no authentication to call, but all tokens and
   * credentials returned are subject to strict validation and business session
   * expiration policies. Only intended for the 'user' role as defined by the
   * database schema.

   * Refresh JWT authentication tokens for 'user' role using

   *
   * This endpoint refreshes JWT authentication tokens for an authenticated
   * 'user'. It uses the 'todo_list_auth_sessions' table to validate the
   * provided session_token (refresh token) by checking for matching, active,
   * unexpired, and non-revoked session. It also confirms the linked user exists
   * and is not soft-deleted ('deleted_at' is null). Session expiration
   * ('expires_at') and revocation logic are strictly enforced per schema and
   * business rules, ensuring users can only refresh tokens when all security
   * conditions are satisfied.
   *
   * If the submitted refresh token is expired, revoked, or does not correspond
   * to a valid, active session, the operation fails with a specific error
   * requiring re-authentication via the login endpoint. Successful refreshes
   * update relevant session metadata (updated_at, user_agent, ip_address) and
   * return new JWT access/refresh tokens per the established session policy.
   * All activity is logged for compliance and security review, referencing the
   * corresponding user account.
   *
   * Operation is only available to authenticated users presenting a valid
   * refresh token (session_token); it does not require explicit authentication
   * on call but uses token validation per security best practices. Tightly
