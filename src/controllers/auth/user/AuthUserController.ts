   * Register a new todo_list_user account and issue authentication tokens.

   * This registration endpoint allows users to sign up for the Todo List
   * application by providing a unique email address and password. The process
   * creates a record in the todo_list_user table, which is the main actor
   * entity representing all regular users and owners of todo items.
   *
   * Registration utilizes the 'email' as the core identifier, enforcing
   * uniqueness as per schema constraints. Passwords submitted are hashed and
   * stored in the 'password_hash' column, ensuring no plain text passwords are
   * ever persisted or exposed in responses, aligning with security
   * requirements.
   *
   * Role-based business logic restricts this operation to unauthenticated
   * clients only. Permissions enforce that already-registered (authenticated)
   * users are blocked from accessing this operation for themselves, promoting
   * single-account policy by design.
   *
   * Upon successful registration, initial JWT access/refresh tokens are
   * provided, granting full authenticated session rights matching the 'user'
   * role, as allowed in the permissions matrix.
   *
   * This endpoint is tightly coupled with the login and token refresh
   * operations, forming the core user account lifecycle. All error handling
   * around uniqueness, validation, and secure storage is derived directly from
   * the todo_list_user schema fields.

   * email, then compares the provided password (after hashing) with the stored
   * password_hash. Authentication success results in the issuance of JWT access
   * and refresh tokens compliant with session policies for the 'user' role.
   *
   * All fields handled map directly to the todo_list_user tableâ€”primarily
   * 'email' and 'password_hash' (used internally). Authentication tokens
   * returned are constructed without exposing any sensitive fields or database
   * identifiers.
   *
   * Role-based business logic ensures this operation is available only to
   * unauthenticated users. Existing sessions must be invalidated or expired
   * before invoking login again.
   *
   * Security is paramount: rate limiting may be applied to repeated failed
   * attempts per system policy (not encoded in this schema). All error returns
   * are generic, never indicating which field was incorrect, to minimize
   * information leakage.

  /**
   * Refresh JWT tokens for a todo_list_user session.
   *
   * This token refresh endpoint provides authenticated Todo List users a means
   * to renew their session by presenting a valid refresh token issued during
   * previous login or registration. It validates the refresh token, confirms
   * its association with an existing todo_list_user, and, if valid and
   * unexpired, issues a new set of access and refresh tokens for seamless
   * session continuation.
   *
   * Token logic is implemented per security and session policy: access tokens
   * are short-lived (30 minutes), while refresh tokens may be valid up to 30
   * days, conforming to the requirements in the business documentation and
   * permission matrix.
   *
   * The token refresh process is stateless regarding the underlying
   * todo_list_user schema; it does not alter, create, or remove table records.
   * It simply reads and verifies minimal identifying fields linked to the
   * user's identity. No sensitive info is returned.
   *
   * Security and session enforcement is maintained: expired, invalid, or
   * tampered tokens result in error responses and session invalidation,
   * supporting robust access control.
   *
   * This operation is required to maintain authenticated user workflows,
   * supporting login and join (registration) as the main entry points for
   * session initialization.
