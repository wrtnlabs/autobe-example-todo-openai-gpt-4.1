   * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of todos for a user

   *
   * Retrieve the list of todos for the currently authenticated user, supporting
   * advanced search and filtering. Users can retrieve only their own todos,
   * while admins may access todos across users for audit or troubleshooting
   * purposes. The results are ordered with the most recently created tasks
   * first by default. The business rule enforces that only the owner (role:
   * user) or an admin (role: admin) can access a user's todos; unauthorized
   * attempts are denied and logged.
   *
   * This operation applies field-level filters (content, completion status, due
   * date window) and supports pagination parameters like page size and offset.
   * Results exclude todos from soft-deleted users or invalid states. Input
   * validation prevents negative page sizes or offsets, and content queries are
   * trimmed & sanitized. This operation is critical for productivity workflows
   * in the Todo list app, enforcing data privacy and strict row-level access
   * control.
   *
   * Edge cases—such as empty results or invalid filters—are handled gracefully
   * with clear business error messages and do not leak internal state or
   * information.
   *
   * This endpoint is paired with single-todo retrieval, creation, updating, and
   * deletion APIs for full user task management.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search criteria (content, completed, due_date), sort and
   *   pagination parameters (offset, page size) for todo list retrieval.

  /**
   * Permanently delete a specific todo item from the user's todo list

   *
   * This endpoint allows a user (or admin) to permanently remove a single todo
   * item, identified by its UUID, from the todo_list_todos table. The deleted
   * todo is irreversibly purged; it will not appear in listings, cannot be
   * restored, and all links to this task are erased from the database.
   *
   * To fulfill business logic, the endpoint verifies that the requesting user
   * is either the owner of the todo or holds an admin role. If a user attempts
   * to delete a todo they do not own, or that does not exist, the system denies
   * the operation and returns a business-level error message.
   *
   * When an admin performs a delete, the system must create an associated audit
   * log entry, as described in the audit_logs table specification, to ensure
   * traceability.
   *
   * There is no soft-deletion: records are removed entirely from persistent
   * storage. This behavior is critical for both user privacy and compliance
   * with user-level data removal (right to erasure). Error handling includes
   * returning 'not found' if the todo was already deleted or an invalid UUID is
   * provided.
