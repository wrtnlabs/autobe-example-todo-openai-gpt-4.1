   *
   * Edge cases covered include: whitespace-only content, excessive length,
   * invalid or past due dates, deduplication, and unauthorized submissions.

   * purposes. The results are ordered with the most recently created tasks

   * attempts are denied and logged.
   *
   * This operation applies field-level filters (content, completion status, due

   * Results exclude todos from soft-deleted users or invalid states. Input
   * validation prevents negative page sizes or offsets, and content queries are
   * trimmed & sanitized. This operation is critical for productivity workflows
   * in the Todo list app, enforcing data privacy and strict row-level access
   * control.

   * Edge cases—such as empty results or invalid filters—are handled gracefully
   * with clear business error messages and do not leak internal state or
